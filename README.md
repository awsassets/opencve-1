# OpenCVE

This is the deployement for [OpenCVE](https://github.com/opencve/opencve) using Docker container.

## Description:

OpenCVE is a platform used to locally import the list of CVEs and perform searches on it (by vendors, products, CVSS, CWE...).

Users subscribe to vendors or products, and OpenCVE alerts them when a new CVE is created or when an update is done in an existing CVE.
